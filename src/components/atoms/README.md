# Atoms

Basic UI building blocks. These are the smallest components that can't be broken down further.

Examples:
- Button
- Input
- Avatar
- Badge
- Loading spinner

## Guidelines
- Should be highly reusable
- Should not contain business logic
- Should accept props for customization
- Should be well documented with TypeScript interfaces
