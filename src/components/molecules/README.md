# Molecules

Components made of atoms. They serve as the backbone of design systems.

Examples:
- SearchBar (Input + Button)
- CharacterCard (Avatar + Text + Badge)
- FilterDropdown (Select + Label)

## Guidelines
- Combine atoms to create more complex UI pieces
- Should have a single responsibility
- Can contain some business logic related to their function
- Should be reusable across different contexts
