# Organisms

Complex components made of molecules and atoms. These form distinct sections of a page.

Examples:
- CharacterList (grid of CharacterCards)
- Header (with navigation and search)
- CharacterDetail (detailed character information)

## Guidelines
- Combine molecules and atoms
- Represent distinct sections of your interface
- Can contain significant business logic
- Should manage their own state when appropriate
