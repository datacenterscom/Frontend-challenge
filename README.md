# Rick & Morty Frontend Challenge - Tasks

Welcome to the Rick & Morty Frontend Challenge! You have **1 hour** to complete as many of these tasks as possible. Focus on quality over quantity - it's better to complete fewer tasks well than to rush through all of them.

## 🎯 Your Mission

Build a character listing application that fetches and displays Rick & Morty characters using GraphQL.

## 📋 Task List

### Phase 1: Analysis & Core Setup (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal: Understand the requirements and set up the foundation**

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Analyze the project structure
  - Explore the existing codebase and understand the setup
  - Identify what components need to be created
  - Review the available GraphQL endpoint and data structure

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Implement data fetching
  - Connect to the Rick & Morty GraphQL API
  - Fetch character data and handle the response
  - Implement proper error handling for API failures

- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Create the character display
  - Design and implement components to display character information
  - Ensure proper component hierarchy following atomic design principles
  - Display essential character details (image, name, status, etc.)

### Phase 2: UI/UX & Responsive Design (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Goal: Create a polished and responsive user interface**

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Implement responsive design
  - Ensure the layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Create an appropriate grid system for character display
  - Test and optimize for different screen sizes

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Enhance visual design
  - Style components with a clean, modern design using tailwind
  - Add visual indicators for different character statuses

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add loading and error states
  - Create loading indicators while data is being fetched
  - Design user-friendly error messages
  - Provide options for users to retry failed operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)
**Goal: Add enhanced functionality if time permits**

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Enhance user interactions
  - Add interactive elements (hover effects, animations)
  - Consider adding character detail views or modals
  - Implement smooth transitions and micro-interactions

## ⏰ Time Management Tips

- **0-15 min**: Focus on Phase 1 - get the desing plan
- **15-40 min**: Work on Phase 2 -  get the basic listing working
- **40-60 min**: Attempt Phase 3 if time permits, or polish existing work

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Review the existing codebase and understand the structure
2. Start with Task 1.1 - get the character listing working
3. Test your implementation frequently
4. Ask questions if anything is unclear

**Good luck! Remember, focus on doing fewer things well rather than rushing through everything.** 🌟
